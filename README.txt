HoverTweet

This is a simple Chrome extension that loads and displays Tweets without clicking on them. It does this by parsing the URL of a tweet when you hover over a link, loading the page in the background, and extracting the relevant details (name, photo, message).

Potential updates:
• Holding a key allows you to move mouse independently to click links within tweets
• Display images embedded within tweets
• Show date/time of tweets
• Show comments/retweets/favorites of tweets
• Mark links as visited once you've hovered over them
• Options/settings page to change font size, window size, etc
